# Stock Analysis
## Project Overview
My good friend Steve needs some help analyzing green stocks for his parent's portfolio. His parents had invested in DQ and Steve wants to explore the possibility of diversifying their portofoloi with other green stocks. Steve will compare DQ's rate of return with 11 other green stocks. In short, there are 12 green stocks that needed to be analyze for the years 2017 and 2018 based on their total daily volume and rate of return. 
### Purpose
The project's purpose has two parts. First, to analyze multiple stocks using a scripted code in VBA and second, once complete, find a more efficient way of rewriting the code so as to lessen the run time. The concept of this project was to learn about loops, design patterns, and reusing codes. 
## Results
Using a nested loop, the script was able to analyze all the 12 green stocks for the specify year in a timely manner. The results are as follow:
